# Tips for how to print cap

First print the support for cap. Put some Kapton Tape over the flat side of the support. Slice the cap in your slicer software, put a pause point before the bridge layer, then print.

During the print, when paused, put the support with the Kapton Tape side up, then continue the print, so you can get a cap with smooth under surface.
