# HP Compaq IPAQ G750 Keyboard Bluetooth Adapter


This project makes a Bluetooth adapter for the G750 foldable keyboard. This keyboard was meant to use with vintage PDAs (Windows CE, Palm, Clie etc.). It was sold under various brands (HP, Compaq, Dell etc.) and has multiple models (G750, G7L0, G7L1, etc.). But as long as they have the same key layout, this adapter should work for them.

Note that there are some versions for Palm OS, e.g. G700 for Treo, these keyboards have different key layouts, and use a different protocol. So they are not supported by this project yet.

The G750 keyboard uses an distinctive folding mechanism that slides out to both sides, while the middle piece raises up to the same level. A connector is propâ€™ed up to provide connectivity to the PDA. This project achieved Bluetooth functionality by replacing that connector module with a custom designed Bluetooth module.
