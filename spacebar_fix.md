# How to fix the reliablity of the spacebar for G750

The spacebar of the G750 (and similar variants) has the issue of not reliably register, this is due to the spacebar balancing mechanism does not provide enough pressing force to the membrane. We can fix that by adding some paddings to the back of the keycap.

1. Carefully remove the spacebar keycap. The technique is demonstrated in the [G750 Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8__Df5YKs4), you just need to do it to the two scissor structures for the spacebar.
2. Find a piece of about 0.8mm thick plastic card (e.g. a used credit card), cut it to 5x5 mm size.
3. Use some double-sided tape or super glue, to glue it to the back of the spacebar keycap, then snap the keycap back.

Now the spacebar should have better actuation reliability.
